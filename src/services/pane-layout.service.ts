 * clamp to the nearest edge — an out-of-range number is rejected to
 * {@link DEFAULT_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION} wholesale, on the theory that a
 * value someone bothered to push out of bounds (or corrupt/mistyped state)
 * is more likely wrong than "close enough". `MIN_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION` and
 * `MAX_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION` are themselves **accepted** (inclusive bounds).
 * This is the validation boundary for persisted settings and webview
 * messages — both untrusted — so it never throws and never returns a value
 * outside `[MIN_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION, MAX_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION]`.
 *
 * @param raw - Candidate value of unknown provenance (config, webview message).
 * @returns `raw` unchanged when it is a finite number within bounds;
 *          otherwise {@link DEFAULT_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION}.
 *
 * @example
 * clampVarsHeightFraction(0.25);   // → 0.25
 * clampVarsHeightFraction(0);      // → DEFAULT_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION (would collapse the section)
 * clampVarsHeightFraction('0.3'); // → DEFAULT_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION (wrong type, untrusted input)

 * any linked sheet, and a percentage `max-height` against an indefinite
 * containing block computes to `none` (CSS 2.1 §10.7) — the configured
 * value would silently vanish. `vh` is relative to the viewport instead, so
 * it matches T1's own fallback (`calc(100vh / 6)`) and actually applies.
 *
 * Callers must pass a fraction that already went through
 * {@link clampVarsHeightFraction} — this function does no validation of its
 * own, it only formats.

 * @param fraction - A fraction already within `[MIN_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION, MAX_VARS_HEIGHT_FRACTION]`.
